# PythonProgrammingExercises2
Python Programming done in second half term - Oct - Dec 2017

Created the first Strings python notebook exercise with

1) print() - outputs to the screen

2) str() (and int()) - converts strings to integers and also the other way
 
3) input() - gets input from the user, always a string. Use int() if you want to use input as a number
